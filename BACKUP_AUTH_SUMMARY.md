## 🔑 Authentication After Restore

### Important: Login Credentials from Backup

When you restore a backup, **the login credentials from that backup are restored**.

**What this means:**
- If you changed your password after the backup was created
- The restore will bring back the OLD password from the backup
- You must use the OLD password to login after restore

### Example Scenario:

1. **October 1:** Password is `OldPassword123!`
2. **October 5:** Backup created (contains `OldPassword123!`)
3. **October 10:** You change password to `NewPassword456!`
4. **October 15:** System crashes, you restore October 5 backup
5. **Result:** Password is now `OldPassword123!` again (from the backup)

### How to Check Password in Backup:

```bash
# View the backed up .env file
cat /Users/jmahon/Documents/Battery/backups/backup_[timestamp]/.env | grep ADMIN
```

You'll see:
```
ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=$2b$10$...
```

The hash is encrypted, but it represents the password that was active when the backup was created.

## 🔐 Password Recovery Using Backups

### If You Forget Your Password:

**Option 1: Restore Recent Backup**
```bash
cd /Users/jmahon/Documents/Battery
npm run restore
# Select most recent backup
pm2 restart solar-dashboard
# Login with password from that backup
```

**Option 2: Generate New Password**
```bash
cd /Users/jmahon/Documents/Battery
node -e "const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs'); bcrypt.hash('NewPassword123!', 10, (err, hash) => { console.log(hash); });"
# Copy the hash
nano .env
# Update ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH
pm2 restart solar-dashboard
```

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### Protect Your Backups

✅ **DO:**
- Store backups in encrypted locations
- Limit access to backup directory: `chmod 700 backups/`
- Use encrypted external drives for off-site backups
- Keep backups secure (they contain login credentials!)
- Test restores regularly

❌ **DON'T:**
- Never commit backups to git (already in .gitignore)
- Never email backups unencrypted
- Never store in public cloud without encryption
- Never share backup folder (contains passwords!)

### Backup Directory Permissions

```bash
# Secure the backup directory
chmod 700 /Users/jmahon/Documents/Battery/backups

# Verify permissions
ls -la /Users/jmahon/Documents/Battery/ | grep backups
# Should show: drwx------  (700)
```

---

## 📊 Backup Contents Verification

### Check What's in a Backup:

```bash
ls -lh /Users/jmahon/Documents/Battery/backups/backup_2025-10-10T22-28-15/
```

Output:
```
-rw-r--r--  alert_settings.json
-rw-r--r--  backup_info.json
-rw-r--r--  daily_stats.json
-rw-r--r--  data_history.json
-rw-r--r--  .env                ← Contains authentication!
```

### View Backup Metadata:

```bash
cat /Users/jmahon/Documents/Battery/backups/backup_*/backup_info.json | tail -15
```

Output:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-10T22:28:15.000Z",
  "files": [
    "alert_settings.json",
    "daily_stats.json",
    "data_history.json",
    ".env"
  ],
  "version": "7.2.0",
  "backedUpCount": 3,
  "sensitiveCount": 1,
  "skippedCount": 0,
  "containsSensitiveData": true
}
```

## 🚨 Emergency Recovery Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Forgot Password

**Solution:** Restore most recent backup (contains your password)
```bash
npm run restore
# Select backup #1 (most recent)
pm2 restart solar-dashboard
# Login with password from that backup date
```

### Scenario 2: Accidentally Changed Password

**Solution:** Restore backup from before password change
```bash
npm run restore
# Select older backup from before change
pm2 restart solar-dashboard
```

### Scenario 3: Complete System Failure

**Solution:** Full restore from backup
```bash
cd /Users/jmahon/Documents/Battery
npm run restore
# Select most recent backup
pm2 restart solar-dashboard
# Everything restored: data + credentials
```

### Scenario 4: Moving to New Server

**Solution:** Copy backup and restore on new server
```bash
# On old server:
npm run backup
scp -r backups/backup_latest/ user@newserver:/path/

# On new server:
cd /path/to/app
mkdir -p backups
mv /path/backup_latest backups/
npm run restore
pm2 start app.js --name "solar-dashboard"
```
